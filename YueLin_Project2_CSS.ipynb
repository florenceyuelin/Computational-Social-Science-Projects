    "**MODEL DESCRIPTION(S):** \n",
    "1. **Linear regression**: it models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors or features).  \n",
    "    - Assumptions: (1) linearity: a linear relationship between predictors and the target, with each predictor having a certain weight or coefficient. (2) Independence: observations (data points) are independent of each other. (3) Homoscedasticity: constant variance of errors (residuals) across all levels of predictors. (4) Normality of Residuals: the residuals follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "    - Pros: (1) simple and interpretable; (2) provides insight into the impact of individual predictors or features; (3) serve as a baseline model for more complex methods.\n",
    "    - Cons: (1) assumes a linear relationship, which may not hold for complex data; (2) sensitive to outliers; (3) does not handle multicollinearity well.\n",
    "    - Suitability for this problem: many of the columns in this dataset include socioeconomic variables like region, race, gender, and age composition, which are assumably important predictors of the target (i.e., numbers of people suffering from diabetes) and have been backed by domain knowledge in existing literature. We could hypothesize a linear relationship between, say, numbers of people with obesity and the target, as shown in plots above in the EDA stage. Hence, we can say that linearity is likely between other variables and the target. Moreover, each observation cell in the target column is independently collected and coded at the county level, so we realize the \"Independence\" assumption.  \n",
    "***\n",
    "2. **Ridge regression**: a regularization technique applied to linear regression. It aims to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the linear regression's cost function. This penalty term (L2 norm) encourages the model to have small coefficient values, effectively reducing the impact of less important predictors. \n",
    "    - Assumptions: hold the same assumptions as linear regression (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals). Additionally, it allows the presence of multicollinearity, where predictor variables are highly correlated. \n",
    "    - Pros: (1) mitigates overfitting by shrinking coefficient values; (2) effective at handling multicollinearity; (3) suitable for situations with many predictors; (4) useful when the primary goal is predictive accuracy rather than model interpretability.\n",
    "    - Cons: (1) all features are retained, so it does not perform feature selection; (2) interpretability can be reduced due to shrunken coefficients (towards zero but not set exactly to zero), which is particularly salient for situations of having many predictors in a model, Ridge will make it harder to discern the most influential predictors.\n",

    "***\n",
    "3. **Lasso regression**: another regularization technique applied to linear regression. Just like Ridge, Lasso also adds a penalty term (L1 norm) to the linear regression's cost function. Although the cost function for both Ridge and Lasso are similar, Ridge takes the square of the coefficients whereas lasso takes the magnitude.  Lasso encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates, effectively performing feature selection by pushing some coefficients to exactly zero, as compared to Ridge which never sets the value of coefficients to zero. \n",
    "    - Assumptions: hold the same assumptions as linear regression (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals).\n",
    "    - Pros: (1) performs automatic feature selection, simplifying models; (2) effective in high-dimensional datasets. One cannot fit a linear model where there are more features than there are observations (data points). Lasso can do so by adding a penalty term based on the absolute values of the coefficients to the linear regression cost function, and encouraging some coefficients to become exactly zero. As a result, it selects the most relevant features in high-dimensional datasets while simultaneously mitigating the risk of overfitting; (3) handles multicollinearity well.\n",
    "    - Cons: (1) feature selection bias (e.g., loss of information; Lasso may not perform well when all features are important; Lasso's automatic feature selection can disregard certain domain knowledge; etc.); (2) can lead to unstable coefficient estimates when there is multicollinearity. This is because Lasso struggles to choose between highly correlated features in the face of multicollinearity. It can set some coefficients to zero arbitrarily, making results sensitive to minor data changes. This instability means different runs can yield different features and coefficients, hurting model reliability.\n",

It is relevant to machine learning problems because it helps us understand and manage the tradeoff between model complexity and predictive performance. In other words, it helps strike the balance between underfitting and overfitting, ultimately leading to better model performance on real-world data."

    "**Answer:** Overfitting refers to the scenario where the model has learned the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations rather than the underlying patterns. As a result, a model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on unseen data (e.g., test data), which degraded the performance and generalization ability. To address the overfitting problem, there are many techniques. For instance, cross-validation has the advantage of allowing every data point to be in the test set once. By averaging the errors, the model is less sensitive to variation in the random samples, and is less prone to overfitting. In addition, increasing the size of a dataset can help reduce overfitting, since more data provides the model with additional examples to learn from and reduces the likelihood of fitting noise. What's more, pruning can help reduce the complexity of decision trees. Removing branches of the tree that do not provide significant information gain, which can help prevent overfitting."

    "**Answer:** Based on the coefficients of the Lasso model after hyperparameter tuning, we can see that Southeast has the highest cofficient (.00419) among all regions, suggesting people in the Southeast are more prone to suffer from diabetes than other regions. Hence, we should prioritize Southeast if there is any program or initiative to reduce diabete rates and enhance public health. \n",

    "If we consider features like race, gender, or age composition in a region, we can see that females over 65 years old (with a coefficient of .004) and white Americans (with a coefficient of .006) are the groups who should be most prioritized for, given that they are more likely to suffer from diabetes based on the coefficient results. \n",

    "I am actually confident about applying this model to the real world, given that the `RMSE` in the test dataset is relatively small, suggesting a good fit. The results from the plots and regression models indicate that the model match the domain knowledge and theories we have: old people without enough physical activities tend to suffer more from diabetes. We also observe some geographical variations (e.g., people in certain regions have higher diabete rates), and this could be true since people may have different cuisinary traditions, which may involve more sugar intake that leads to more diabetes."
